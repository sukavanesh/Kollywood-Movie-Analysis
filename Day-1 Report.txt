Day 1 Report
Task: Data Collection

This Folder will contain the datasets that we created.

Data Collection Process:
>>We searched for random movie datasets available in the internet.
>>We found that websites have more meaningful information as we were unable to find a perfect and suitable dataset.
>>We used a Web Crawler Tool - "Parsehub" to crawl data from websites.
>>Website we crawled from: 
	LINK --->	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/top-rated-movies/tamil/best-movies/2020/2742916
>>We found that the website contained the data of the top best 30 movies released every year with 
	i)User rating
	ii)Critic rating
	iii)Movie information
	iv)Synopsis
>>We managed to extract the data for the past 10 years and we thought about collecting 300 top best movies of the decade.
>>The collected data required some initial cleaning.
>>We used python (Jupyter Notebook) for the dataset to be ready and perfect. 
>>Enclosed Documents: 
	Initial Data Cleaning.ipynb
