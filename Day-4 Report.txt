Day 4 Report
Task: Optimisation of the Entire Process

>>Everything went fine so far, but suddenly we realised that a movie is not based on lead actor or actress alone. We found that our data didnt have anything to contribute to Directors and Music Directors. Hence we added those columns for each and every movie.
>>We wanted to know how much importance or impact that genre had on tamil cinema. So we created a survey using survey heart app and then forwarded to all our friends and well-wishers.
>>We closed the survey after we got about 50 responses and that was considered to be the sample.
>>Finally after working with that we came to find that people like tamil movie to have a pinch of every genre to it.
>>Derived Conclusion:
	Best Director in Tamil Cinema - Genre: Thriller - Mysskin
	Best Director in Tamil Cinema - Genre: Social Awarness - AR Murugadoss
	Best Director in Tamil Cinema - Genre: Drama - Suseenthiran
	Best Music Director in Tamil Cinema - Yuvan Shankar Raja
>>Conclusion from Survey:

	i)The sample that we selected had very similar interests. It explains that they prefer the presence of every aspect of every genre in general.

	ii)So our audience would like to watch a movie with every element of art in it like a combo of flavours. They would like to have a touch in every emotion they prefer.

	iii)Also, our audience feel like the presence of a strong social message in a film would be very much influential.
