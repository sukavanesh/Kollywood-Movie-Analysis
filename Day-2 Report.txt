Data Visualization Process:
>>We discussed about the different hypothesis that we could make with the data we have and shortlisted a few from below:
	1. Visualize the data to find the Actor with most films in top 30 list. (Most Dominating Actor)
	2. Visualize the data to find the Actress with most films in top 30 list. (Most Dominating Actress)
	3. Visualize the distribution of User Rating.
	4. Visualize and Analyze the genre of the movies in the dataset.
	5. Visualize the Censorship Certificate of the movies in the dataset.
	6. Visualise the Movie release trends with respect to Release Month.
>>We were able to visualize all the above discussed hypothesis successfully.
>>We used Google Colaboratory - Online cloud-based notebook environment. (colab.research.google.com)
>>We started with some required data cleaning steps and then proceeded to visulaize the discussed hypothesis.
>>Conclusion Observed:
